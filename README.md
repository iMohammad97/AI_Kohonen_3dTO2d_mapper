# AI_Kohonen_3dTO2d_mapper
Training a Kohonenâ€™s Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOFM) which can map a dataset of 3- Dimensional data into a 2-Dimensional space.
First, create 1600 colors in RGB space randomly. All Red, Green, and Blue values must be between 0 and 255. Then feed this dataset of 3D data to the network and represent it into a 40x40 map of nodes, which can be shown as a picture with height and width of 40 pixel.
The goal is to take the 3D color vectors and map them onto a 2D surface in such a way that similar colors will end up in the same area of the 2D surface.
